# Reconfiguration of replicated systems

This repository contains exercises for my lecture on reconfigurable replicated systems.
Exercises are small programming tasks. Examples are build using the [Gorums](https://github.com/relab/gorums/blob/master/doc/user-guide.md) RPC framework.

* [storage](./storage/) contains some small tasks to get to know the example application and the Gorums framework.
* [reconfstorage](./reconfstorage/) contains tasks to implement reconfiguration mechanisms for the same application.
